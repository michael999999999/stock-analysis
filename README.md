# VBA of Wall Street

## Steve has recently graduated from his finance class, and his parents have decided to be his first clients. They would like to invest their savings in Daqo New Energy Corporation, a leader in green energy which produces the photovoltaic cells used in harnessing solar power.

### Steve has gathered a few alternatives to Daqo and has requested his Excel workbook be upgraded with macros in order to run several analyses. He will then use this information choose the best fit for his parents. The accompanying documentation includes the workbook with requested macros for easy use, as well as images demonstrating his stocks 2017 and 2018 performance. 

## Analysis

Based on the information provided by Steve, it would appear that Daqo Corp (ticker: "DQ") had a very strong 2017, as did 10 of the other stocks named. 11 out of the 12 options ended the year "in the green", some significantly so, with DQ topping the list at +199.4%! Other big winners include SEDG at +184.5%, ENPH at +129.5%, and FSLR at +101.3%.

Results would take a turn for the worse in 2018, however, with 10 of those same stocks actually ending the year in the red. DQ stood out again, this time for the wrong reason as the largest loser. DQ ended the year -62.6%, followed by JKS at -60.5% and SPWWR at -44.6%.

In my unprofessional opinion, it would seem as though ENPH would be the better option over DQ. ENPH showed growth in both years of data, +129.5% with the rest of the sector in 2017, and continuing that trend +81.9% in 2018. This shows strength as it was only one of two "green" stocks up in a year where that sector as a whole suffered. Of course, "past performance is not indicative of future success."

Additionally, while the +199.4% for DQ in 2017 would seem promising, they were the least traded of the 12 stocks, returning a volume of only 35,796,200. For comparison, the next lowest 2017 volume was HASI at 80,949,300, then VSLR at 109,487,900. Further, in 2018 they were the 3rd lowest in volume at 107,873,900, sandwiched between HASI at 104,340,600 and VSLR at 136,539,100. Being towards the bottom of volume in both years seems to demonstrate a lack of interest in the stock, especially considering most other stocks saw a rise in volume.

## Results

As for the Excel document itself, the macro running the analysis was able to be refactored in a way that significantly improves performance. The prior code relied on nested loops performing mathematical equations, whereas the refactored code made use of VBA arrays. While mathematical equations must be used either way, arrays can help the process by storing values on the fly where nested loops require multiple passes through multiple loops, ending up slower and becoming more of a "resource hog".

![2018_Refactored_Code](https://github.com/michael999999999/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

Using VBA's timer function, I was able to find that the original macro took .765625 seconds to populate 2017 stock results, and .78125 for 2018's results. After refactoring, 2017's results were returned in .15625 seconds while 2018's came back in a whopping .1484375! While these differences seem practically imperceptable, consider the improvement this would show on a much larger data set. The refactored code saw an amazing 80% reduction in processing time versus the original code!

## Summary

In summation, the results would show that refactoring code can vastly improve system performance with a reduction in resource usage. While it would seem to be a "no-brainer" to refactor all code in order to make improvements, a drawback to this process would be the time invested in order to refactor the code. A cost/benefit analysis would need to be accomplished to compare the time one would need in order to refactor code versus the number of times the code will be used in practice. Many hours could end up being wasted on scripting a macro which would only end up being used a handful of times. However, if a macro will be used often enough to justify it, refactoring code can easily reward the end user with a more positive computing experience.
