# VBA of Wall Street

## Steve has recently graduated at the top of his finance class, and his parents have decided that they will be his first clients as a graduation gift. Steve's parents would like to invest the money they've saved in a company by the name of Daqo New Energy Corporation. Daqo Corp produces the photovoltaic cells used in harnessing solar energy, and appears to be the hottest new thing in the "green energy" field.

### Steve has gathered a few alternatives to Daqo and has requested his Excel workbook be upgraded with macros in order to run several analyses, which he will use to choose the best fit for his parents. The accompanying information includes the workbook with requested macros for easy use, as well as images demonstrating how refactoring code can significantly improve macro performance.
