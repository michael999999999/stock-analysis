# VBA of Wall Street

## Steve has recently graduated from his finance class, and his parents have decided to be his first clients. They would like to invest their savings in Daqo New Energy Corporation, a leader in green energy which produces the photovoltaic cells used in harnessing solar power.

### Steve has gathered a few alternatives to Daqo and has requested his Excel workbook be upgraded with macros in order to run several analyses. He will then use this information choose the best fit for his parents. The accompanying documentation includes the workbook with requested macros for easy use, as well as images demonstrating his stocks 2017 and 2018 performance. 

## Analysis 

- The written analysis has the following:

Based on the information provided by Steve, it would appear that Daqo Corp (ticker: "DQ") had a very strong 2017, as did 10 of the other stocks named. 11 out of the 12 options ended the year "in the green", some significantly so, with DQ topping the list at +199.4%! Other big winners include SEDG at +184.5%, ENPH at +129.5%, and FSLR at +101.3%.

Results would take a turn for the worse in 2018, however, with 10 of those same stocks actually ending the year in the red. DQ stood out again, this time for the wrong reason as the largest loser. DQ ended the year -62.6%, followed by JKS at -60.5% and SPWWR at -44.6%.
